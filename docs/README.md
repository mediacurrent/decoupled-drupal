# Decoupled Drupal with Gatsby

## About Mediacurrent

Mediacurrent is your single source digital partner for development, design, strategy, and training. We also offer ongoing Drupal support options. The quality of our work allows organizations to grow while saving significant money over time.

## Getting Started

This repo will allow you to get the codebase to build a new Gatsby website which has been configured to pull its content from Drupal. Both Gatsby and Drupal run locally.

### Requirements

#### Operating System:

* macOS 10.13 or later
* Windows 10 Pro+ or equivalent \(eg Windows 10 Enterprise\) with Hyper-V running
* Linux with kernel version 4.x or higher

#### Software:

* Docker - [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Windows 10](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* Lando - [macOs](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html#macos) or [Windows 10](https://medium.com/@jiles/installing-lando-docker-and-composer-on-a-windows-10-pro-environment-e405efba2c96)
* NVM
* NodeJS & NPM

**Instructions for installing NVM, Node & NPM on** [macOS](https://medium.com/@jamesauble/install-nvm-on-mac-with-brew-adb921fb92cc) or [Windows](https://codeburst.io/nvm-for-windows-how-to-install-and-use-13b7a4209791).

## 1. Clone the repo

You can clone or download the repo anywhere in your computer \(i.e. Sites, Downloads, Documents, Desktop, etc.\)

```text
git clone git@github.com:mariohernandez/gatsby_training.git
```

## Install Gatsby CLI

Before you can run gatsby commands like `gatsby develop`, you need to install the Gatsby CLI globally.

* Open your command line tool like Terminal \(macOs\), or PowerShell \(Windows\)
* Run the following command:

  ```text
  npm install -g gatsby-cli
  ```

## 3. Build the environments:

* After cloning the repo, cd into the newly created directory:

**NOTE**: _This is the default directory generated by cloning the repo. If you changed the directory name when cloning the repo, cd into that directory instead_.

```text
cd gatsby_training
```

#### Start Lando

```text
lando start
```

_This will build your Docker containers needed to run Gatsby and Drupal. **NOTE**: Docker needs to be running before running `lando start`._

#### _Start Gatsby_

_Since Gatsby pulls data from Drupal, Drupal needs to be running by completing the previous step first._

```text
cd gatsby
```

```text
nvm use
```

_If you get errors, you can try running:_ `nvm install` then `nvm use`. _This will use the version of node specified inside `.nvmrc`_

```text
npm install
```

_This will install all of Gatsby/node dependencies_.

```text
gatsby develop
```

_This will start Gatsby which should immediately connect to Drupal to pull all content_.

## 4. Access your Gatsby and Drupal sites

#### Gatsby:
