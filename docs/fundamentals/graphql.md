# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

Loading data with GraphQL is fairly similar to directly loading JSON, but it provides extra benefits like automatically optimizing images and keeping the data loading in the same place where it’s used.GraphQL is not required, but the benefits of adopting GraphQL are significant. GraphQL will simplify the process of building and optimizing your pages, so it’s considered a best practice for structuring and writing Gatsby applications.
