# JAMStack

JAMstack is a web development ecosystem based on client-side Javascript frameworks, reusable APIs and/or micro-services, and prebuilt markup such as static site generators.

With the rise of git-centric workflows, continuous delivery, and the overall popularity of the web - JAMstack architecture provides a modern day approach to building web applications that are scalable, fast and built to maximize a developers' efficiency.

## Some Benefits of JAMstack:

**Security** Static sites have very little vulnerabilities since they have minimal points of entry for attacks. All the dynamic functionality is handled externally with APIs.

**Better Performance** Monolithic origins that require builds for every visitor can have have poor performance results. Pre-built markup can be served up quickly.

**Lower Cost** Maintenance costs such as upgrades, backups and general cleanup are all reduced. Hosting flat static files is extremely cost-effective.

**Scalability** Removes the need for scaled up architecture and is out of the box ready for high traffic.
